PRIVACY POLICY

The app requires permissions to access your contact list and file system.

1. Permission for contact list is required so that you can pick contacts from within the app to start chatting.
2. Permission for file system is needed since you have the provision of logging your direct chat history.

In either case, no data is collected by us since the app entirely works offline. Only WhatsApp requires network-related permissions.
